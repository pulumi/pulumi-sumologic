/**
 * Provides a [Sumologic Partition](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/partitions-data-tiers/).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as sumologic from "@pulumi/sumologic";
 *
 * const examplePartition = new sumologic.Partition("examplePartition", {
 *     name: "examplePartition",
 *     routingExpression: "_sourcecategory=*&#47;IAC",
 *     analyticsTier: "continuous",
 *     isCompliant: false,
 *     isIncludedInDefaultSearch: true,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Attributes reference
 *
 * The following attributes are exported:
 *
 * - `id` - Unique identifier for the partition.
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Partitions can can be imported using the id. The list of partitions and their ids can be obtained using the Sumologic [partions api][2].
 *
 * hcl
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import sumologic:index/partition:Partition partition 1234567890
 * ```
