/**
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as sumologic from "@pulumi/sumologic";
 *
 * const this = sumologic.getRoleV2({
 *     name: "MyRole",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as sumologic from "@pulumi/sumologic";
 *
 * const that = sumologic.getRoleV2({
 *     id: "1234567890",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * A role can be looked up by either `id` or `name`. One of those attributes needs to be specified.
 *
 * If both `id` and `name` have been specified, `id` takes precedence.
 *
 * ## Attributes reference
 *
 * The following attributes are exported:
 *
 * - `id` - The internal ID of the role. This can be used to create users having that role.
 * - `name` - The name of the role.
 * - `description` - The description of the role.
 * - `capabilities` - The list of capabilities associated with the role.
 * - `selectedViews` - List of views with specific view level filters in accordance to the selectionType chosen.
 * - `auditDataFilter` - The search filter which would be applied on partitions which belong to Audit Data product area. Help Doc : (https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/audit-index/).
 * - `securityDataFilter` - The search filter which would be applied on partitions which belong to Security Data product area.
 * - `logAnalyticsFilter` - The search filter which would be applied on partitions which belong to Log Analytics product area.
 * - `selectionType` - Describes the Permission Construct for the list of views in "selectedViews" parameter.
 * ### Values in selection type are :
 *   - `All` selectionType would allow access to all views in the org.
 *   - `Allow` selectionType would allow access to specific views mentioned in "selectedViews" parameter.
 *   - `Deny` selectionType would deny access to specific views mentioned in "selectedViews" parameter.
