/**
 * Provides an easy way to retrieve a folder.
 *
 * You must specify the absolute path of the folder to retrieve. The content library has "Library"
 * folder at the root level. For items in "Personal" folder, the base path is "/Library/Users/user@sumologic.com"
 * where "user@sumologic.com" is the email address of the user. For example, if a user with email address
 * `wile@acme.com` has `Rockets` folder inside Personal folder, the path of Rockets folder will be
 * `/Library/Users/wile@acme.com/Rockets`.
 *
 * For items in "Admin Recommended" folder, the base path is "/Library/Admin Recommended". For example,
 * given a folder `Acme` in Admin Recommended folder, the path will be `/Library/Admin Recommended/Acme`.
 *
 * ## Attributes reference
 *
 * The following attributes are exported:
 *
 * - `id` - The ID of the folder.
 * - `name` - The name of the folder.
